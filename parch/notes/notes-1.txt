The libc library is a system library that provides implementations of many standard C functions, as well as various other system-related functions and variables. Some common functions and variables provided by libc include:

Memory management functions, such as malloc, calloc, realloc, and free
String manipulation functions, such as strcpy, strcat, strcmp, and strlen
Input/output functions, such as printf, scanf, fopen, fclose, and fgets
Mathematical functions, such as sin, cos, tan, and sqrt
Signal handling functions, such as signal and sigaction
System-related functions, such as exit, abort, getpid, and gettimeofday
Global variables, such as errno (which stores the error code of the last system call that failed)

To see a list of functions and variables provided by the libc library on your system, you can use the nm or objdump utility with the -T option, for example:

nm -D /usr/lib/libc.so | grep printf
objdump -T /usr/lib/libc.so | grep printf

The nm command lists the symbol names and addresses of all global symbols in the library, while the objdump command lists the symbol names, addresses, and associated libraries for all symbols in the library.

The order for 4 argument is rdi ->rsi -> rdx -> rcx.
