0xac // higher + lower
'a'=0x61 // 8 bits
low memory address + high memory address

decimal -> hexa
highest significant bit to low memory address or another approach high memory address
Little Endian => Least significant byte to low memory address

struct.pack("<i",1000) // < Little Indian, i = integer
struct.unpack("<i","")[0] // more details in python


======== w4 =======
pwn service > template.py
io.recvuntil(b"from menu: ")
io.sendline(b"1")

diff = rbp - rip // need to overwrite
bp - buffer + 8

win address ? // look into binary of objdump command

return address - () + () // win address

=== another way to debug ====
./template.py GDB
gdb server 
attach progrma to current binary
